# Simple Queue Service (SQS) 
    SQS - PULL Service
    SNS - PUSH Service

-> SQS is a fast, reliable, fully managed message Queue Service
-> It's a webservice that gives you access to message Queues that store messages waiting to be processed
-> It offers a reliable, highly scalable, hosted queue for storing messages b/w servers
-> It allows the decoupling of application components such that a failure in one components does not cause a bigger problem to application functionality (like in coupled app)


-> Using SQS, you no longer need a highly available message cluster or the burden of running it 
-> you can delete all the messages in an SQS queue without deleting the SQS queue itself
-> you can use applications on EC2 instances to read and process the SQS queue messages
-> you can use autoscaling to scale the EC2 fleet processing the SQS messages, as teh queue size increases
-> These applications on EC2 instances can process the SQS messages/jobs them post the results to other SQS Queues as other AWS Service

***> AWS Queue Types
    - Standard Queue
        - High (unlimited) throughput
        - At least one delivery
        - duplicacy is possible
        - best effort ordering
    - FIFO Queue
        - limited throughput (300 TPS)
        - Exactly one processing
        - Strict ordering -> FIFO
        - FIFO Queues are limited to 300 transactions per second (TPS), but have all the capabilities of Standard queue

***> SQS Pricing

-> The first 1 million monthly requests are free, after that pricing is according to regions
-> Interaction with Amazon S3
-> Interaction with Amazon KMS 

**> How SQS Charges

-> API Actions - every Amazon SQS action count as a request
-> FIFO Request - API actions for sending, receiving, deleting and changing visibility of messages from FIFO Queues are charged at FIFO rates
-> Contents of Request - A single request can have from 1 to 10 messages, upto a maximum total payload of 256kb
-> Size of payload - Each 64kb chunk of a payload is billed as 1 request (e.g. - API action with a 256kb payload is billed as 4 request)
